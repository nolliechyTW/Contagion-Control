# Contagion-Control 
The virus COVID-19 is spread from close contact with an infected person. Now you are going to design an algorithm to find the chain of the virus from one person to the next, identifying and isolating those people. For simplicity, let N be the number of citizens, each denoted by 0, 1, 2, ..., N − 1. Then each citizen writes down the citizen he/she comes in contact with. To avoid typing these numbers by hand, use the shuffling algorithm to generate a random sequence of 0, 1, 2, ..., N − 1 for testing. 


# Control-by-Groups
Modify the solution to show all group members and calculate how many groups in the random sequence.
